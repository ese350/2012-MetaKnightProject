This project's focus is to develop a low-cost physical therapy aid.  Here are some of the goals of the project.

1.Observance
⁃Map the way the arm moves in the 3d plane
⁃Track the arm angles as accurately possible with the current tech
⁃Maybe add more sensors later?
⁃Non-compliance
⁃Can track people

2. Guidance
⁃Map the desired motion on screen for the patient to follow
